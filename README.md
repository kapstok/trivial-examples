# Trivial examples

This repository contains several trivial example which can be used as
fundament for actual projects. Below a short overview of each example.

## [Bytecode OS](bytecode-os)

An example on how to create the most basic kernel that processes
given bytecode. A bootloader is included, so it is bootable and can be
run as virtual machine.

## [D to Ruby FFI](d-to-ruby-ffi)

This example shows how to compile a shared library in the programming
language D and use it in arbitrary Ruby code.

## [Post mortem debugging](post-mortem-debugging)

C(++) code can crash due to an error. This example shows how to examine
the error after the crash occurred.

## [Black noise generator](black-noise-generator)
A project that plays black noise (silent audio).

## [Executable File Patching](executable-file-patching)
This demonstrates how one can compile an exectable and let the executable show
its own size without using File I/O. It is a technique where information gets
injected into the executable directly.
